I really liked this project again.
I think that the subject, could have been more precise to explain the file UserCredentials. 
Indeed, I didn't really understood how it was working : we don't ask the client for a password in the parameter but he needs one to connect, the salt is stored uncrypt which can be dangerous.
Moreover, all the password we store in files are not encrypted which is a lack of security I think. 

To write my code, I looked at the code in :
